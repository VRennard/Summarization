The prototype was yellow and red and was shaped like a mushroom.
The remote will be shaped like a pineapple.
Whether to use a mushroom or another fruit or vegetable as the basis of the shape of the remote.
The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototype for the remote.
The team then conducted a product evaluation of the prototype.
The remote will have a scroll wheel.
The team then engaged in a project evaluation in which the team discussed the process of creating their product.
The team decided that the prototype required further work.
Having a base on the remote which the user is required to turn in a circular motion in order to change the channel.
The case of the remote will be single curved.
The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost.
The remote will be made of plastic.
In discussing the production costs, the team settled on what features they wanted in the remote, while staying within the boundaries of their budget, and decided it was not necessary to completely redesign their product.
The corporate logo will need to be incorporated into the product.
The remote will have one solar cell.
Overall, the team found the prototype to be technologically innovative but had some issues with the prototype's appearance and its usability.
The remote will feature only one push button.
The project manager Sebastian opens the meeting.
The project manager closes the meeting, telling each group member what he is responsible for and reminding them that they will receive more information by email.
They did not decide yet what type of remote control to produce- whether it should be for a specific device or universal.
They will target the international market.
The project manager designates each group member's task- working on the working design, technical functions, or user requirement specs.
They will generate a proft of fifty million Euros.
After that they briefly discuss finances.
They need to generate a profit of fifty million Euros.
The project manager states the goal of the project, which is to develop a new remote control.
A group member asks whether it is going to be a stand-alone unit, or one that requires a T.V. beforehand.
They will receive more information by email.
Then they take turns drawing their favorite animal on the white board.
The target selling price will be 25 Euro dollars.
He also mentions the three-step project- functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design.
It should be original, trendy, and user-friendly.
The rest introduce themselves, including Michael the interface designer, Guillermo the marketing expert, and Hemant the industrial designer.
The main concern is that they do not know what the product is, yet they have to make it fit that price bracket.
The project goal is to develop a new remote control.
The remote control's target selling price of twenty-five Euro dollars and will be for the international market.
The marketing expert presents some research done on user opinions of remotes.
The remote control should be fancy, a good shape, and not too small or too big.
The industrial designer will work on the component concept.
He suggests the use of using voice recognition or an LCD, which they discuss despite concerns about budget limitation.
Although the project manager clearly does not favor the idea because of budget costs and the possible requirement of internet connection, others are pushing for it.
Corporate logo will be clearly displayed on product.
They have not yet decided whether to include an LCD screen.
The remote control will be for television only.
They find that the budget is restricting their capabilities, and mentioned increasing the price of the remote control.
He suggests they name the project and they come up with "mando", meaning "control" in Spanish.
He suggests they have two types of user interfaces and brings up that voice recognition would increase production price.
The interface specialist will work on the user interface.
The marketing expert will work on trend-watching.
The industrial designer presents, showing examples of existing products and suggesting they add a scroll wheel for channel-changing.
Because of budget restrictions, they cannot do speech recognition technologies.
He says Internet capability might be necessary for an LCD and then brings up button size, suggesting having a flip-open door with extra buttons under it.
The project manager opens the meeting stating that they will address the functional design of the remote and saying they are still undecided about whether it should be universal or specific.
To target towards young people will bring in new technology.
They talk about the budget limitations on features and then the project manager summarizes decisios made and closes the meeting by teeling each group member what he should work on.
They discuss voice recognition again, and then the interface specialist presents.
He suggests putting two scroll wheels- one for changing the channel and another for the volume.
He shows them his plan what the remote control could look like and the features it might have.
The group has not yet agreed on whether the remote should be banana-shaped.
He annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit, which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control.
They do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape, and one group member feels that the shape is not handy.
Then they move on to the three presentations.
They have the option of using that technology.
Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum.
Before the next meeting, the interface specialist and industrial designer have to work together on the user interface and the look/feel design.
Eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana.
After that the project manager has them discuss/reiterate the decisions made during the meeting:  no LCD screen, the remote will have a base station, a RF for beeping, a button on the base station to press, possibly a stylish banana-shape for the control, 2 scroll wheels to control the volume and channels at the thumb level, a turbo button perhaps underneath the device, on/off button for the TV.
In addition, he talks about giving the control a double curve, curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle.
The remote will have a base station, a button on the base station to press, 2 scroll wheels for the channels and volume, a turbo button (possibly underneath the device), and an on/off button for the TV.
They go on to have discussion, with one member suggesting that they make the banana more stylized so that it looks less like a banana- for example, it could be silver.
They then begin talking about using a fruit, vegetable, or natural object as the shape of the remote, the logo, or for the buttons.
He also included a turbo button for speed, which he thinks every design should have.
There is concern that the shape is not handy and might make the product less marketable- that would be a problem since they have to meet the fifty million euros profit goal.
They agree on having base station with the remote.
The project manager opens the meeting, stating that it is about conceptual design.
The industrial desiger tells them they will use a regular chip rather than the advanced one since pricing is a factor.
Thus far, LCD and ASR have been ruled out.
After that the interface specialist talks about having a base station for the purpose of finding the remote control when lost.
The marketing expert has to look up product evaluation.
Since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the LCD screen idea.
Lastly, the industrial designer presents, discussing the power source of the remote control.
He suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good.
Next, the user interface specialist presents.
He talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell, which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design.
The marketing expert is first to present, and he talks about making a pleasant-looking device, particularly one that favors current trends.
He restates the last meeting's descision that they will not do speech recognition technology but says they still have to decide whether to use an LCD screen.
The case will be single curved.
The remote will not include a pen.
Whether to include a pen to use with the touchscreen on the remote.
After the project manager opened the meeting, the industrial designer discussed his preference for making a remote which is single-curved, made of rubber, contains an LCD, has a docking station to recharge the batteries, and uses a simple chip.
The user interface designer discussed how speech recognition could be useful to users who often lose their remotes, the layout of the interface, and the option to include a scroll device on the side of the remote to access a menu containing extra features.
The remote will use rechargeable batteries which recharge in a docking station.
Whether the remote requires a CPU.
The remote will have a scrolling device.
Position of buttons.
The team discussed case shapes, color options, types of rubber, and dimensions.
The marketing expert discussed the results of trend-watching reports and his preference for a banana-like remote for younger people and a traditional remote for older people.
The trend-watching reports indicated that products should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, in fruity colors, in soft and spongy materials, and in hard materials in autumn colors with square shapes with round edges if appealing to elderly people.
What sort of batteries to use.
The remote will use a chip on print.
Color of remote.
The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board
Whether to use hard or soft rubber.
The case will be made of rubber.
The team then made decisions regarding energy sources, components, and the remote interface.
What shape the remote should be.
Position of a microphone on the remote.
The team found the remote to be fancy, innovative, fairly easy to use, available in different colors, fairly spongy, difficult to misplace, and targeted to younger people.
The remote will use an advanced chip.
Whether to make a remote out of wood or to make a remote with different colors.
The case will be single curved.
Whether to keep the speech recognition component.
The remote uses a conventional battery.
The case is made of rubber.
Whether the remote appeals to younger people.
The project manager then led the team in an evaluation of the project process.
What colors to make the remote in.
The project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented their prototype for the remote which featured an LCD screen, a scroll button, and a battery indicator.
The team found the project stressful, the equipment useful, the information available to them lacking, and their laptops to be slow and heavy.
The remote will not use a sample speaker and feature speech recognition.
Whether LCD screens and microphones are components or features.
The remote will not feature a scroll wheel.
The team members will go to their own rooms.
The project manager then led the team in calculating the production costs of their remote.
The team had difficulty in meeting the the target cost and had to eliminate some of the more expensive components they had hoped to include in their design.
The marketing expert conducted a project evaluation of the prototype.
Whether to lose the scroll wheel.
The project manager will create a final report
Whether to lose the curvature in the design of the remote case.
Size of microphone.
To get started they will assume the remote to be for TV and video, and reserve the possibility to add features.
They close the meeting upon establishing what each person will do.
The group practices using the smart board by choosing an animal to draw and then explaining why they picked it.
The aim is to seel 50 million Euros.
The marketing expert will come up with user requirements by doing internet research.
The interface designer should specify technical functions.
They decide to first assume it is only for TV and video, but allowing the possibility to add more features.
The industrial designer should produce a working design.
The team again discusses their individual responsibilities and move on to ponder whether the remote will be multifunctional or only for the TV.
They will receive more information by email
When the meeting begins the project manager lists the agenda and then describes the project, which is to develop a new remote control that is original, trendy, and user-friendly.
They briefly discuss characteristics of a desirable remote, including medium size buttons, small unit, and work within a good zapping range.
The production cost should be half the selling price.
The project manager goes over the product budget and they proceed to have discussion.
They each identify their individual tasks during each phase based on their role in the group.
The product will be sold at 25 Euros.
The industrial designer described how a remote works, and explained that his presentation was incomplete because he had not received the necessary information in time.
The marketing expert reported on research which shows that users think most remotes are ugly, easily lost and bad for RSI.
There was some confusion about the the roles of the user interface designer and the industrial designer.
The project manager will write up the meeting minutes.
Audio settings are rarely used, and the power, channel and volume buttons are used most often.
The remote will have an LCD screen and speech recognition.
The remote will be for TV only.
The group decided to use an LCD screen and speech recognition.
There will be LEDs under the buttons so that buttons in use will light up.
The remote will feature the corporate logo and colour.
The user interface designer showed examples of two contrasting remotes, recommending that they should use the best features of both.
A teletext option will not be included.
The screen and microphone will be at the top of the remote.
The user interface designer will work on the layout of the remote and the LCD screen menu.
The advanced functions such as audio settings, contrast and channel programming will be accessed through the screen.
The industrial designer did not receive the necessary information in time to prepare his presentation according to instructions, so his presentation was based on his own ideas.
The group discussed what functions to include and the layout of the remote, and the marketing expert drew a possible design on the board.
The remote should be user-friendly and have a good look and feel.
The target group will be aged 16-40.
The industrial designer will work on the functional aspects of the remote.
Some people had problems using the computers.
They decided to have buttons for the basic functions and make the advanced functions accessible through the screen.
They also discussed what buttons would be needed to navigate the menu on the LCD screen.
The marketing expert and project manager described the new requirements that the target group is users under 40, the remote should not include teletext, should be only for TV, and should feature the corporate logo.
The marketing expert will prepare the prototype evaluation.
The group were unsure about whether the remote should flip open or not and had trouble agreeing on a colour scheme.
The project manager ran through the group's decisions so far and led a discussion of their remaining options, including the colour of the case and buttons, and whether the remote should flip open or not.
The remote will use an advanced chip.
For users, the three most important aspects of a remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, and ease of use.
The marketing expert talked about trendwatching and explained that the current trends are for fruit and vegetable themed products and products with a spongy texture.
The group were unsure whether they would be able to produce their design for 12.5 euros as they had not yet received any information about costs.
The group decided on using kinetic energy, and a double-curved rubber case.
The case will be double-curved and made of rubber.
The remote will use kinetic energy.
The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on the prototype design.
The user interface designer talked about speech recognition and what functions will be controlled through buttons or the lcd screen menu.
The industrial designer talked about the options for energy source, case shape and material, and internal components.
The group were unsure about the difference between a single- and double-curved case.
The group were unsure whether to use a single- or double-curved case.
The industrial designer continued to have problems using power point, and felt that he did not have enough time to prepare his presentation.
The group were satisfied with the overall score of 3.1.
The remote will be powered by a hand dynamo instead of kinetic energy.
The group felt they should have been given the information about costs before designing the prototype.
It will be made of plastic instead of rubber.
The industrial designer and user interface designer worked on a drawing of the new design, while the project manager and marketing manager worked on the final report.
The group discussed which features should be dropped.
The project manager led an evaluation of the project process.
The group were unsure about which features to drop and which to keep.
The group thought that they worked well together, especially after the first meeting.
The project manager will complete the final report.
The group decided that the LCD screen was integral to their design, but dropped the speech recognition.
The project manager decided to start by looking at costs instead of the prototype presentation because the original design was too expensive and had to be changed.
The remote will no longer feature speech recognition, but will still have an LCD screen.
They were happy with the room for creativity, but thought they were limited by the budget.
The group's original design was too expensive, costing 25 Euros, so the remote had to be substantially redesigned.
It will have one integrated scroll push-button and no other buttons.
They decided to drop all the buttons in favour of an integrated scroll push-button, and to use a hand dynamo instead of kinetic energy as a power source.
The industrial designer was unsure about the value of the evaluation score.
The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation, based on the new design.
They preferred the digital pens to the SMARTboard.  They had mixed feelings about using PowerPoint.
The group discussed their initial ideas of features to include in the design; the Marketing Expert discussed usability features, such as the ability to control multiple devices and an LCD screen, to make the product unique.
The group discussed the timing of when they would make decisions on the features discussed.
The participants introduced themselves and their roles to each other.
The Project Manager introduced the aim of the project and gave a brief agenda for the entire project.
The Project Manager presented the project budget and explained that the device would not be made very high-tech due to the small budget.
He explained that the device would be sold internationally.
The group had difficulties deciding when to make decisions on the features they mentioned in their discussion.
The User Interface Designer will research the technical functions.
The group decided that it was important to incorporate a feature that would make the product very unique.
The group could not decide whether or not the remote should be able to control multiple devices.
The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to work on the working design and the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions.
The group acquainted themselves with the materials by drawing on the smartboard.
The Industrial Designer will work on the working design.
He then introduced and explained how to use the meeting-room materials.
The industrial designer begins explaining the working design.
He talks about existing products, most of which use infared since it is simple and cost-effective.
They will fill out the questionaire
The interface specialist presents, talking about the possible components of the remote and concluding that the remote should be simple and accessible without too much functionality.
The marketing expert explains various user preferences and complaints about remotes as well as different interests among age groups.
They will receive specific instructions for the next meeting by email.
The group closes the meeting and goes to lunch.
The marketing expert is first to present, summarizing user requirements data from a questionaire given to 100 respondents.
The group continues the meeting by having discussion about the possibility of a touch screen, LCD, and other functions.
He suggests adding a speech function, when someone asks where the remote is and it beeps.
The group is interested in incorporating a touch screen by that could be too difficult to use, especially for elderly people.
The group has brought up a number of technological possibilities, have conflicting views about them, and have not yet made decisions about them.
He prefers that they aim users from ages 16-45, improve the most-used functions, and make a placeholder for the remote.
He also explains the various components, materials, and energy sources of a remote, giving preference to a remote with multifunctional buttons and without a receiver.
When this functional design meeting opens the project manager tells  the group about the project restrictions he received from management by email.
Which features should be removed or changed.
Overall, the group were satisfied with the creativity, teamwork and available equipment, although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful.
The overall rating was two.
There was some confusion about the agenda.
The remote will have an LCD screen.
The group discussed how to make the design cheaper, and decided to keep the LCD screen, but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons.
The industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design, made of yellow rubber and hard plastic, with large, mostly blue buttons, a joystick and LCD screen.
The remote will be a normal colour rather than a special colour.
Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting.
The project manager calculated the production costs, which were too high at fifteen Euros.
The production costs of the initial design came to fifteen Euros, so the design had to be changed.
Which chip would be needed for the revised design.
The remote will have regular push-buttons instead of a joystick.
Led by the marketing expert, the group evaluated the prototype on a scale of one to seven, based on a set of evaluation criteria.
The remote will control multiple devices.
However, they were unsure about what the budget would allow.
The project manager closed the meeting.
Each member of the group will work on their individual tasks.
They also discussed having glow in the dark buttons, using bluetooth instead of infrared and using a display and/or a joystick instead of conventional buttons.
The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project, describing what the project would involve, the role of each participant and the agenda for the first meeting.
The project manager then asked the others about their initial ideas.
He the demonstrated the equipment the group would be using, and the group practiced using the SMARTboard by drawing their favourite animals.
The remote control will be sold for 25 euros with a profit aim of 50 million euros.
They will receive information from their personal coaches.
The group were unsure about whether they would be selling their product directly to consumers or to electronics manufacturers.
The industrial designer gave a brief presentation about his role and his initial ideas for the project, suggesting that the remote should be used for multiple devices and that the group should consider using bluetooth rather than infrared.
The project manager suggested that the remote should be rechargeable or not use much power, but this might be difficult if using bluetooth.
The remote will be sold internationally.
Whether using glow in the dark buttons and bluetooth would mean that the remote consumes too much energy.
The production costs should be no more than 12.50 euros.
The user interface designer agreed that the remote should control multiple devices.
The remote will be sold directly to individual consumers rather than companies.
It was felt that the low production costs would not allow them to create a trendy high-end product.
The project manager then went over the project budget.
The group will design a trendy, original and user-friendly remote control.
The latter would be preferable to implementing a backlight into the remote.
The UI will present the user interface concept.
Using them sparsely, as in mobile phones, could bring down the cost.
The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one.
It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it.
The target group will be people below 40.
The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels, volume, program selection, and speech recognition, with a focus on simplicity of design.
Despite that, customers may want them to be on a remote; furthermore, they can be designed in a more attractive way.
LED's can be used to light up the remote.
An expanded target group may have to be taken into account in order to achieve the projected sales and profits.
It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition.
The remote could light up via LED's placed inside.
A recharging cradle can be added to compensate for the extra energy consumption.
The industrial designer will look into what would be an appropriate technology to help users find their remote, when it is lost.
Power-saving LED's are available, but these could be more expensive.
LED's would signify extra energy consumption.
A single, large, round button can be used for both volume and channel selection by using the four separate quadrants.
The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.
The remote will also include volume and program selection, and speech recognition.
Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose.
Adding such features may complicate the design and escalate costs.
However, this solution may prove too expensive.
Similarly, using an extra base station would probably be too costly.
There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.
The discussion also focused on their replacement with speech recognition, as the latter helps with locating the remote as well.
The ID will present the components concept.
Another button to switch between two channels could also be implemented.
The project manager will add the minutes into the project folder.
It's difficult to choose a technique to find a lost remote.
The marketing expert will need to find information on current trends.
There was a challenge regarding the need of the digit channels, based on the fact that they are not often used, and they also look dull.
They cannot install a special button on a TV, and using a special signal, like clapping, is tricky, because it needs to be differentiated from normal sounds.
The use of infrared, energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested.
They can be made of plastic, rubber, wood or titanium.
LCD is not going to be implemented.
The marketing expert will carry out a product evaluation.
A scroll wheel will be included in the design.
It is not clear whether a kinetic dynamo can be used, because it is unlikely that a user shakes the remote enough, as one would do with similarly powered watches.
The company colours (grey and yellow and black) did not seem sufficiently bright and trendy to everyone.
Cases can be flat, single- or double-curved.
For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use.
Hand or kinetic dynamos, batteries, and solar cells can be used as energy sources.
The ID and UI will also have to figure out whether to use rubber just for the buttons and side finish, or for the whole front of the remote.
They will also try to find a way to promote the corporate identity in the design of the look and feel and interface.
Changeable covers for the remote control can link the product to current fashion trends, but also trends followed by other age groups.
They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device.
A single-curved rubber casing can also be used.
LCD screens may add an extra hi-tech touch, but given all the other features, it might be too much.
The use of a scroll wheel with integrated button was debated, as not everyone was convinced of its use for this project.
Using the speech recognition on the device may not be convenient, since the remote will have to pointing towards the TV at the same time for the infrared to work.
Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote.
The preferred energy source was a combination of batteries and solar cells.
The front could have a rubber finish, or the buttons will be made of rubber.
Printing an image on the remote to make it more colourful is doable, but cannot be done by the manufacturing department.
The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype.
The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote, and could also provide themes for other target groups.
The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells.
The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition, in black and yellow, the company colours.
Possible interfaces are push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCDs. A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute.
It was debated that customers may prefer a total spongy texture, not just in the buttons and the sides of the remote.
The delay in providing costs of components was criticised.
The device cannot be a hi-tech, innovative one any more.
The prototype will have to be redesigned, so that it is compatible with the budget constraints..
The criteria used were fancifulness (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (2.5), whether it is easy to find (1), sponginess (1.5), number of features (1).
An extra button could activate/deactivate the voice recognition.
The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition.
The idea to include a solar cell as a power source had to be abandoned, due to the escalated costs.
The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well.
The team thought all the changes to accommodate the budget requirements made a very dull device.
It would cost 22 euros.
Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory, but the digital pens were alright, but not too useful).
The same happened with the speech recognition.
The rubber case is yellow with grey or black, with buttons either made of plastic or rubber.
The prototype proved extremely over budget.
It was suggested that they go for a completely simple design so as to maximise the profit, although this was not what was asked in the project requirements.
The prototype proved extremely over budget.
One way to compensate for the loss of features, but still attract their target group, would be to add more colour to the design.
After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad).
It can be used as a normal remote, but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface.
The remote is just going to be for TV.
The whole team tried out the SMARTboard, by drawing their favourite animals.
The project will be completed with three further meetings: the following meeting concerns the functional design.
The remote  needs to be produced for 12.50 euros in order to be sold for double that amount.
The team will also take into account possible usability issues concerning disabled people.
The team will also take into account possible usability issues concerning disabled people.
The project manager gave a quick overview of the equipment available.
The project manager gave a quick overview of the equipment available.
The team comprises the project manager, the marketing expert, who is looking at user needs, the user interface designer, looking at usability, and the industrial designer, working on the engineering and materials.

The design should generally be intuitive without changes that would render it an unfamiliar object to customers.
The design should generally be intuitive without changes that would render it an unfamiliar object to customers.
The goal of the project is to design an original, trendy and user-friendly remote control for TV.
They also agreed to choose light materials.
Afterwards, they discussed briefly their first ideas, including the use of light materials and usability concerns.
It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control, when the user loses it.
On the other hand, materials should be more durable.
It might be possible to use a charger for the remote.
Consumers claim they would pay more for a remote with LCD screen, but adding the component might be too expensive.
Different TVs have different functions incorporated in their built-in menus, making it hard to know in advance which buttons you can do without on the remote.
The target group will be people below 40.
A button that sticks on the TV could be pressed to make the lost remote beep, and perhaps also light up.
Customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes.
He will also draw some ideas for the shape of the remote.
In the case where it is added, the issue would be whether to place it at the top or the bottom of the remote.
He will also check into the importance and possibility of using rechargeable batteries and a charger.
The marketing expert will need to find information on current trends and see into the financial issues concerning the integration of a charger.
They drew some of their ideas, and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the LCD.
The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.
Because symbols may fade, the additional covers could include those.
Using a charger for the remote may be too expensive.
Using a charger for the remote may be too expensive.
The team also discussed extensively the positioning of various buttons.
The team also discussed extensively the positioning of various buttons.
Symbols on remotes fade with time.
Symbols on remotes fade with time.
Buttons should be made bigger, with clearly defined functions and of durable materials to avoid fading of the symbols.
The remote is going to be a universal one.
The most used buttons are going to be placed on top.
The need for clarity of button functions was mentioned.
They like innovative technology like speech recognition and LCD screens.
It may not be technically possible for a universal remote control to create menus for various advanced settings on the TV itself.
The team will also examine whether they can use an LCD and/or speech recognition.
The remote will need to be different from those available in the market in terms of shape and colour.
Finally, they will try to think of a name for their product.
The company colours and slogan will have to be shown on the device.
The ID will present the components concept.
The industrial designer wondered whether the remote should be universal or programmable.
Everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design, and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes.
It also transpires that remotes are easy to lose.
The important buttons will be on top.
Speech recognition and LCD screens could be added to the remote control, but they might be too expensive for this project.
There are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40, the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.
The criteria used were look and feel (1), whether it is easy to find (1), whether it is easy to learn (2), use of LCD (3), speech recognition (7), trendiness (2).
The PM is going to finish the project report.
It was imperative that some of the features had to be taken out.
The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design.
The remote control is going to be called Triple-R.
The team were unable to communicate amongst themselves in between meetings, which hindered the flow of information.
The precise use of the LCD was not defined: it could be used for TV configuration, or, if possible, for displaying the TV programme and previews.
The production cost was 17 euros, 4.5 more than the budget.
The latter was taken out, along with the special colour.
The prototype proved over budget (17 euros).
It incorporates both LCD screen and speech recognition.
There was disagreement over whether the special colour should be scrapped and the look to rely on the separate covers.
Because the prototype was over budget, the team decided to take out the speech recognition from the design.
They also discarded the special colour, and decided to rely on the changeable covers for an attractive look.
Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (satisfactory), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard could be improved in terms of response time, the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time).
Although the SMARTboard was useful to draw ideas quickly , it could be improved in terms of response time.
Other solutions, like abandoning the curve of the casing or replace the rubber with plastic were also suggested.
The UI and ID will send him their design to include.
The rubber case is yellow with black buttons and dark yellow for the menus.
There are buttons for teletext, favourite channel, mute and OK.
Finally, the decided to call their design Triple-R.
Everyone agreed that the financial information should not have been given to them at the last moment.
They were also not allowed to raise the budget limit.
Similarly, the digital pens did not allow the user to work on more than one page at a time.
After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad).
