This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype.
The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype, although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive.
It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface, which also serves as mechanism for locating the device.
The gratuitous presence of decorative rubber strawberries on a titanium case (even if they cover sensors) did not meet everyone's approval.
When it became evident from the costs of components and materials that they would have to do without either the LCD or the speech recognition, they decided to change the given prices in order to accommodate them to their design and budget.
The prototype was more than 40% over budget.
The team realised that their budget did not allow for all the specifications of their prototype.
Although, the attempt was towards keeping with the current fashion trends, the result did not satisfy the program manager.
Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership.
After the team realised the prototype was over budget, they replaced the battery with a hand dynamo.
The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion.

The Project Manager asked the Industrial Designer to create a functional design plan for the device, then asked the Marketing Expert about ideas for the sales strategy.
The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan: to analyze the competition and to pinpoint the target marketing group.
There was a lack of sufficient information from the board on their expectations for the design of the remote, whether they expected a simple device or a more costly one with many features.
The User Interface Designer will make a presentation on the user interface concept.
The Project Manager will research companies that can provide the Industrial Designer with help on integrating voice recognition into her design.

The group then discussed other means of promoting the product: launching the remote at the same time as a large sporting event or DVD release.
He will also present the new promotion plan to management.
The group also discussed the distribution and promotion of the product on the internet.
The product featured an LCD display, a flip panel, and a customizable case back.
The product evaluation will occur at a later time, after the production of some real units have been produced, rather than evaluating the prototype.
The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the integration of the display into the design.
The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the addition of the display.
The group will work with other companies to promote the product and have it released along with other products or with an event, such as a sporting event.

The meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly, telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house.
The marketing expert resumes, talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful.
They do not know if their budget will allow them to include all the features they would like to such as a light emitter, clock, alarm clock, and child lock.
They will maintain the corporate image by using the proper designs and colors.
They discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children, making the buttons various shapes, and putting a display clock on the control.
They are concerned about making the control marketable to a wide range of age groups, and have discussed making removable plastic covers so that the look is changeable.
The project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated, and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors.
They discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases.
This will require further research by the industrial engineer.
She suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable, using a rechargable battery, and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip.
The group would like to include voice recognition as a feature, but they are not sure about how much it would cost.
They about the power source and review the objectives of the product.
The industrial designer will come up with a user interface design.
They decided that the product should be bright, colorful, trendy in design, strong, compact, have push buttons, and contain supplement features (possibly mute button, swapping button, voice recognition).
