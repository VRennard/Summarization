The group decided to focus on a basic remote that will appeal to the widest market.
They also decided to market the speech recognition component as a "finder function" so as not to confuse it with more advanced speech recognition components in other remote controls.
It uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition.
The first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top.
On the other hand, it was argued that the special colours and form compensated for that.
A sample sensor was included to add speech recognition.
Although over budget, the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes.
The team were not certain to what extent the prototype satisfied recognisability of the corporate identity.
The case will be made of plastic.
Finally, some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition.
After changing the case material from rubber to plastic, it was debated that the loss of sponginess does affect the fancy appeal and trendiness of the remote.
However, the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting, especially since the requirements restricted it to TV only, and the budget was too small.
The remote is going to be powered by kinetic energy.
On a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2), technological innovation (2), ease of use (1), incorporation of fashion elements (2), and brand recognition (2).
The team have two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting to complete before they finish.
The remote will be single-curved with a cherry design on top.
Volume buttons will be lemon-shaped and coloured.
The buttons will be made of rubber mostly in a light blue colour.
A simple chip is going to support the electronics of the device.
However, volume and channel buttons will be different from the rest.
They were not certain what the colour of the company logo should be and how the logo should be displayed.
Changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour.
The team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity, although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed.
The initial cost was calculated at 13.70 Euros.
The project manager opens the meeting by introducing herself and asking everyone to say their name and role in the group.

Choosing between an LCD screen or speech recognition.
An LCD screen will be providing functional information, and context tips when using the scrollwheel.
Raising the budget was not an option, although it was promoted as an idea throughout the meeting.
Teamword and leadership were good, but room for creativity impeded by budget constraints.
Along with buttons for numbers, channel selector, volume, mute, on-off, teletext, and subtitles, the prototype included an LCD screen and a help button for functional information.
In the detailed design meeting the team created a prototype.
To reduce this cost, it was decided to replace most buttons with a scrollwheel.
The remaining buttons were one for channel selection, one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel), teletext, on-off and the help button.
The revised prototype will probably be targeted to a younger one, or even across the population.
The project manager will prepare the final presentation, while the rest of the group will fill in a questionnaire.
It was evaluated on a scale from 1 to 7 on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (6), technological innovation (4), functionality (7), consideration of the target group (3).
Standard buttons like the ones for teletext shortcuts were considered superfluous.
A suggestion to target the product to a younger or perhaps more general group was met with approval.
It is not clear whether the budget will allow for a docking station to be produced along with the remote, as it isn't included in the costing sheet.
The project process was deemed well-structured, although everyone thought it would have been better had they known the component prices at an earlier stage.
The non-standard interface (few buttons, scrollwheel) makes the remote unsuitable for older people - the original target group.
All these components were re-arranged in a revised prototype.
The remote was also recognisable as a fashionable Real Reaction product.
The case will be plastic and will be made in single-curve form.
It was suspected that many would not know how to use a scrollwheel, even though it does resemble a radio tuning button.

Specific ideas as to components and materials are to be left to the next meeting.
They will look further at the idea of covers in the mext meeting too.
Individual must come up with their ideas for the next meeting.
It needs to be useable internationally, with few buttons.
They considered taking the best of their competitors designs and making a multifunction remote.
Each member of the team will come for the next meeting with their views on function and design issues that they had not time to consolidate during this meeting.
There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only, they should ignore the teletext function, as it is dated, and, also, the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.
The less frequently used buttons will not be hidden under a flip, as it had been previously suggested, as there are not that many of them; they will just be clearly separated from the more important ones.
A special AV button for direct access to the video channel, although its necessity was disputed, because there are alternative solutions that make it obsolete.
The solution to complaints about remote controls being difficult to learn is to focus on an intuitive design instead of a thorough manual.
They plan to include an LCD screen to display relevant information.
The exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting.
The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip, and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.
The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons.
Other functions are served by push buttons: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down with the last three types being prominent on the device.
The buttons are going to include: OK, menu, screen sizing, AV, settings buttons, mute, digits 1-9, power, volume control, channel up/down.
A discussion on ergonomic solutions like placing the main buttons (power, channel selection, volume) where they can be easily reached with the thumb (as many users complain of RSI), did not reach a conclusion as to whether this would actually cause more repetitive movements.
Some advanced features, like LCD screen with program information or speech recognition, would be very important in order to attract their target group, but there are costing issues that have not been clarified yet.
Functions like zapping are very prevalent, as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose.
The target group will be people below 30.
The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons.
There was some disagreement as to whether the LCD screen should be placed at the top or the bottom of the remote.
An LCD screen is going to be used to display information, but would not be interactive.
The idea of interchangeable fronts was mentioned again; if it were adopted, the company should be recognisable in all the available fronts as well as the remote itself.
There is no need for a special button to recognise two-digit numbers.
It transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes, especially if they include LCD screens and speech recognition.
No consensus was reached regarding the positioning of the main buttons (zapping, volume, power) either: should they be placed close together or more scattered (to avoid RSI complaints)?
He also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours, soft textures and curved shapes.
Finally, they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved.
For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use.
Making changeable fascias can allow for the integration of this or future fashion trends in the device.
They will implement speech recognition as well, because their target group like such gimmicks.
The marketing expert will carry out an evaluation of the product.
The industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons (and no scroll wheel), simple battery (instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo), and advanced chip.
The chip needs to be an advanced one to be compatible with the LCD screen that is going to be incorporated in the design.
They will launch the product with various fronts to choose from including a couple of basic colours or fruit and vegetable themes to go with the current fashion.
The team found a possible conflict between the need for strong materials and the customers' preference for soft textures.
Packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched.
If it is implemented, a recording button, microphone and speaker need to be included in the design.
The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote.
Parts of the front (like the bottom where the LCD is and the top corner where the logo is) will also be titanium.
The team drew a provisional prototype.
The push buttons are going to be made of rubber.
Materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front.
The case will be titanium with a plastic front with rounded buttons.
The version of speech recognition discussed does not link voice commands to actual device actions.
Plastic may be strong, but it does not necessarily look it.
Speech recognition can be implemented, but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions.
The team agreed to place the LCD at the bottom of the device, below the buttons.
The logo will be both at the front and the back of the remote; the company slogan will be engraved at the back.
The industrial designer and the user interface designer will work on a drawing of a prototype, where they will also sort out the details about the buttons.
They placed the LCD below the buttons.
The chip is going to be a standard one.
Changing the front colours may make the front clash with the titanium, but it was also thought neutral enough for it not to matter.
TV settings will be included in menus there instead of having separate buttons for them.
They wondered whether to use both the logo and the slogan on the device and where it would be best for them to be placed.
The buttons include oval digit buttons, arrow-shaped channel and volume controls in the middle; below those, is the menu (for the LCD) and the video button.
The sample speaker was taken out to bring the cost of the prototype down to the original budget of 12.50 euros.
The ID and UI presented the drawing of a prototype.
Replacing the titanium with plastic would have a detrimental effect on the looks of the remote.
Despite disagreement regarding the position of the LCD (top or bottom), the screen was left at the bottom as it was in the prototype.
They also decided to replace titanium with similar-looking plastic for the same reason.
Because it was over budget, titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded.
The LCD can be found at the lower section of the device.
The only way was to go to a regular chip, but that would mean losing the LCD screen, which was integral to the design.
The back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle.
The SMARTboard was considered a disaster as they could not draw, and the digital pens can only be useful for drawings.
Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (generally satisfied), leadership (the process was democratic, not happy with management), teamwork (happy with it), and means (SMARTboard was 'a disaster' and the digital pens only good for drawings).
This was done on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) on fancifulness, ease of use, finding the device when it is lost, hi-tech features, incorporation of fashion trends, and ergonomic design.
After the presentation, the product was evaluated.
The total cost of the prototype was 18.6 euros.
Some people thought that there was no advantage to using the SMARTboard instead of a normal blackboard and chalk, although you can save and reuse things with the former.
The team discussed the possibility to leave the remaining cost at 14.10.
The project manager still disagreed on the position of the LCD: he would prefer it to be at the top.
It is rounded, with the front made of hard plastic in different colours.
The back, as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium.
There was criticism for the shape of the remote (thicker at the ends, thinner at the middle).
They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators.
They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.
They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote.
The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform.
For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings.
The design of the remote control is to be carried out at the next meeting.
He also suggested mobile phone-like changeable covers, and the group discussed the profit in this.
The manager introduced new requirements to the project, insisting they were to be followed.
The project manager opened the meeting by explaining how to locate his minutes from the previous meeting.
The group then discussed their target group ,and what features they might include to attract them.
The Industrial Designer briefly explained the internal workings of the remote,  and mentioned his preferences for power source and case material.
The Marketing Expert present the findings of the usability study.
The buttons will consist of number, a menu button, arrows for changing channel and volume, but also navigating the menu, and a mute button.
Individual actions for the next meeeting can be found in emails to be sent.
The group then discussed what buttons they might need, which included menu, numbers, channel and volume changing arrows and mute.
The User Interface Designer very briefly mentioned some features a remote should have and suggested it should be multifunctional.
The group had a discussion and decided to create two designs, one with an LCD screen and one without, and the interface designer drew them on the board.
The case will be made of hard plastic and rubber.
They put off making a final decision about using an LCD screen, scroll buttons and a menu button until they could find out about costs.
He suggested using a yellow case with rounded edges and the logo at the bottom, and large, clearly marked buttons.
If they can use a menu on the TV screen if the remote does not have an LCD.
Whether to have a trigger-shaped power button.
The group discussed using an LCD screen, but did not have enough information about costs to make a decision.
There was a lack of information about the cost of an LCD screen.
The marketing expert talked about new trends, including the trends for spongy materials and fruit and vegetable themed products.
